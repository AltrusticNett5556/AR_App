AR Game Application

Overview

This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) game developed using Android Studio. The app leverages ARCore to create immersive and interactive AR experiences directly on Android devices. Players can interact with 3D models, play mini-games, and explore virtual objects seamlessly integrated into the real world.

Features

Immersive AR Gameplay: Use ARCore to place 3D game elements in the real world.

Interactive 3D Models: Tap, rotate, and manipulate 3D objects.

Real-Time Tracking: Accurate tracking of surfaces and objects using ARCore.

Customizable Game Elements: Easily replace game assets with your own 3D models.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for easy interaction.

Technologies Used

Android Studio: Development environment for building the app.

ARCore: Google's platform for building AR experiences on Android.

Sceneform: Framework for rendering 3D models in AR.

Java/Kotlin: Programming language used for building the app.

Prerequisites

Android Studio installed on your machine.

An Android device compatible with ARCore (Android 7.0 or later).

Basic knowledge of Java or Kotlin.

ARCore SDK setup in Android Studio.

Getting Started

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

Open the Project in Android Studio
Launch Android Studio.

Select File > Open and navigate to the cloned repository folder.

Wait for the Gradle sync to complete.

Install ARCore
Download the ARCore SDK from ARCore SDK.

Add the ARCore dependencies in your build.gradle file:

dependencies { implementation 'com.google.ar:core:1.38.0' implementation 'com.google.ar.sceneform:sceneform:1.16.0' }

Configure ARCore in the Project
Add the following permission to the AndroidManifest.xml:

Add the ARCore dependency to the app/build.gradle:

dependencies { implementation 'com.google.ar:core:1.38.0' }

Build and Run the App
Connect your ARCore-compatible Android device.

Select Run > Run 'app' or click on the green play button in Android Studio.

The app should start on your device, allowing you to explore the AR experience.

How to Play

Launch the app and point your camera at a flat surface.

Wait for the ARCore to detect the surface (usually indicated by dots).

Tap on the screen to place 3D game objects in the real world.

Interact with the objects by tapping or dragging them.

Customizing the Game

Adding 3D Models: Add new 3D models in the res/raw folder and reference them in your AR code.

Adjusting Game Mechanics: Modify the Java/Kotlin files under src/main/java to change game logic or interactions.

UI Customization: Edit the XML layout files under res/layout to change the user interface.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with ARCore, ensure that:

Your device is ARCore compatible.

ARCore services are up to date on your Android device.

For Gradle sync issues, make sure to use the latest versions of ARCore and Sceneform dependencies.
